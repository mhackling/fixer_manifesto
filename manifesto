So many things are broken and we can no longer trust them
The rules that worked for our parents no longer apply.
Our economies and our democracies no longer work for all of us
Software is eating the world and our lives are now digital.
Everything is digitised and fragile.
A climate emergency calls to us all for action to decarbonise our economies.
Fascists use systems to catalogue and bully us.
The rich use our screens to trick us into blaming each other instead of them
Our machines and our systems need to work for ALL of us, not just the powerful.
You might be one of the rare ones.
One of those who care.
Someone who pulls things apart for a laugh and with determination puts them back together again but better.
Someone who makes for joy, who makes for expression.
Someone who keeps the lights on in the bowels of a datacenter.
One who works within institutions to refresh them.
One who organises and protects the vulnerable from algorithmns that discriminate.
We are of many colors, genders, faiths and nationality but we are one
We hunger for the chance to take the reins.
We hunger for the opportunity to have impact.
We will not stop we are relentless, by the small things we do, we empower others.
We are fixers, and this is our manifesto.
