So many things are broken and we can no longer trust them
Our economies, our democracies, our infrastructure.
Software is eating the world and our lives are now digital.
Everything is digitised and vulnerable.
A climate emergency calls to us all for action.
Fascists use systems to catalogue us.
The rich use our screens to trick us into blaming each other instead of them
Our machines and our systems need to work for ALL of us, not just the powerful.
You might be one of the rare ones.
One of those who cares.
Someone who pulls things apart to put them back again better.
Someone who makes for joy, who makes for expression.
Someone who keeps the lights on in the bowels of a datacenter.
One who works within institutions to refresh them.
One who organises and protects the vulnerable from algorithmns that discriminate.
We exist without skin color,without nationality, without religious bias
We hunger for the chance to take the reins.
We hunger for the opportunity to have impact.
We will not stop we are relentless, by the small things we do, we empower others.
I am a fixer, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
